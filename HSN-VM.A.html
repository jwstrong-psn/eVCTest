      "function" is a JavaScript keyword that allows you to define a function. It is followed by the function's name, a list of inputs in parentheses, and then a block of code in curly brackets. A "return" statement defines the output of the function.
      <br />
      For example:
      <br />
      <span style="background-color: black;" class="code">function&nbsp;add(x,y)&nbsp;{return&nbsp;x+y;}</span>
      <br />
      It can also be defined as a variable or property:
      <br />
      <span style="background-color:black;" class="code">var&nbsp;multiply&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(x,y)&nbsp;{return&nbsp;x*y;};</span>
  </span>
</span> for an example of in-line annotation for special syntax and keywords. As an alternative, clicking the keyword could open a reference sidebar, with further clickable keywords that would navigate in the sidebar only. The possibilities are endless!</p>

  The following lesson is written entirely in JavaScript, with comments (on lines beginning with "//", or between blocks of "/*" and "*/") containing the instruction. There are many other potential ways to display lesson content; this example is written in this format because that's where my mind was at the time I wrote it. Obviously we should take care in choosing how to present the content.
</p>
<p>
  The advantage for now to authoring the whole lesson in code is that you can see how the code works by copying and pasting the lesson content into a JavaScript interpreter (like the browser console), and observing the behaviour of the functions & variables defined.
</p>
<p>
  For this lesson, you can see the results by reading and assigning to the four properties <span class="token variable">x</span>, <span class="token variable">y</span>, <span class="token variable">magnitude</span>, and <span class="token variable">direction</span> of the variables <span class="token variable">cartesian_vector</span> and <span class="token variable">polar_vector</span>. For example:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">polar_vector.y = 3;
console.log(polar_vector.direction);

cartesian_vector.magnitude = 2;
cartesian_vector.direction = Math.PI/3;
console.log(cartesian_vector.x);</code></pre></div>

  Instruction is written for high-school comprehension, but the contextual introduction is a bit long to hold attention, and may be best presented in video or animation.

// Represent and model with vector quantities

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*\
| Vectors have many uses. For some uses it is easier to look at a vector
|  using its x and y components, while for others it is easier to use its
|  magnitude and direction.
|
| When defining a vector variable, it may be tempting to give the vector
|  properties for all of these values, but because they are interdependent,
|  if you want to change one property, you have to make sure the others match.
|
| For example, multiplying a vector by a scalar can most easily be thought of
|  as scaling its magnitude. However, when the magnitude of a vector changes,
|  so must its x and y components. When adding two vectors, you may find it
|  easier to add the x and y components, however doing so also changes the
|  vector's magnitude and direction in ways that aren't quite as simple.
|
| You can simplify these processes in programming by only defining a vector
|  using one pair of values (x and y OR magnitude and direction), and use
|  functions to represent or modify the vector using the other pair of values,
|  when it makes more sense to use those instead.
|
| In programming, a function to find a property in a different way than simply
|  reading a variable's value is called an "accessor" method, or a "getter".
|  A function that changes a property in a different way than simply assigning
|  a value to a variable is called a "mutator" method, or "setter".
|
| You can use getters and setters to work with vectors using all of its
|  properties, without having to manually change its representation.

// First, decide which representation you want to use as the base.
// Define the vector using simple variables for the pair of properties
//  for that representation.

// Here, we use a cartesian representation (x and y components)
var cartesian_vector = {
    x:0,
    y:0
};

// Now define a property to access the magnitude of the vector.
// The property itself will not include a variable, because it will be
//  accessed using a getter and a setter.
var magnitude_property = {};

// Give the property an accessor (getter) function, that calculates the
//  magnitude of the vector using its x and y components
magnitude_property.get = function() {
    return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
};

// Give the property a mutator (setter) function, that changes x and y
//  to match the new magnitude.
magnitude_property.set = function(new_value) {
    // For simplicity, assume a zero vector's direction is 0°, so
    //  assigning a magnitude to a zero vector will create a horizontal
    //  vector with x-value equal to the new magnitude
    if(this.magnitude === 0) {
        this.x = new_value;
        this.y = 0;
    }
    // Setting the magnitude of a non-zero vector requires scaling its
    // x and y components to match
    else {
        var scale_factor = new_value / this.magnitude;
        this.x = this.x * scale_factor;
        this.y = this.y * scale_factor;
    }
};

// Now assign the property to the vector using the name "magnitude"
Object.defineProperty(cartesian_vector, 'magnitude', magnitude_property);

// Now define a property to access the direction (angle) of the vector.
var direction_property = {};

// Give the property an accessor (getter) function that calculates the
//  direction of the vector using its x and y components.
direction_property.get = function() {
    // For simplicity, assume a zero vector's direction is 0°
    // N.B. with atan2, described below, this is unnecessary,
    //  but it's good practice to consider and account for special
    //  cases, usually involving zero.
    if(this.magnitude === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    // For non-zero vectors, the direction can be computed using the
    //  inverse tangent function.
    else {
        // Math.atan2 is a special version of the arctangent function
        //  that accounts for vertical vectors with x = 0, where
        //  tan(theta) = y/x would be undefined (dividing by zero).
        // It also automatically finds the angle in the correct quadrant
        //  (normally arctangent only covers quadrants I and IV)
        return Math.atan2(this.y, this.x);
    }
};

// Give the property a mutator (setter) function that changes x and y
//  to match the new direction.
direction_property.set = function(angle) {
    // Since we assume all zero vectors' directions are 0°, no change
    //  can be made when changing the angle of a zero vector.
    if(this.magnitude === 0) {
        return;
    }
    // Setting the angle of a non-zero vector requires preserving the
    //  magnitude, and setting the x and y components based on the cosine
    //  and sine of the direction's angle from the positive x-axis.
    else {
        // Store the magnitude in a temporary variable, so it is not
        //  computed differently in-between setting the new x-value and
        //  setting the new y-value.
        var magnitude = this.magnitude;
        this.x = magnitude * Math.cos(angle);
        this.y = magnitude * Math.sin(angle);
    }
};

// Now assign the property to the vector using the name "direction"
Object.defineProperty(cartesian_vector, 'direction', direction_property);

// TRY IT!
// Write getter and setter properties for x and y components of a vector
//  defined in polar (magnitude & direction) form.

var polar_vector = {
    magnitude:0,
    direction:0
}

// SAMPLE ANSWER
// Note: sample answer is written at a higher level of proficiency than
//  the example, so it can be used by students to extend their learning.
// Remember, in an ideal implementation, students will be able to click

//  in the lesson proper) to get more background.
