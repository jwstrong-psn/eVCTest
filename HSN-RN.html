      "function" is a JavaScript keyword that allows you to define a function. It is followed by the function's name, a list of inputs in parentheses, and then a block of code in curly brackets. A "return" statement defines the output of the function.
      <br />
      For example:
      <br />
      <span style="background-color: black;" class="code">function&nbsp;add(x,y)&nbsp;{return&nbsp;x+y;}</span>
      <br />
      It can also be defined as a variable or property:
      <br />
      <span style="background-color:black;" class="code">var&nbsp;multiply&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(x,y)&nbsp;{return&nbsp;x*y;};</span>
  </span>
</span> for an example of in-line annotation for special syntax and keywords. As an alternative, clicking the keyword could open a reference sidebar, with further clickable keywords that would navigate in the sidebar only. The possibilities are endless!</p>

  The following lesson is written entirely in JavaScript, with comments (on lines beginning with "//", or between blocks of "/*" and "*/") containing the instruction. There are many other potential ways to display lesson content; this example is written in this format because that's where my mind was at the time I wrote it. Obviously we should take care in choosing how to present the content.
</p>
<p>
  The advantage for now to authoring the whole lesson in code is that you can see that the code works by copying and pasting the lesson content into a JavaScript interpreter (like the browser console), and observing the behaviour of the functions & variables defined.
</p>
<p>
  For this lesson, you can see the results by using the functions <span class="token function">approximate_square_root</span> and <span class="token function">approximate_cube_root</span> repeatedly on the same value to see the iterative function's increasing level of precision. For example:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">approximate_square_root(3);
approximate_square_root(3);
approximate_square_root(3);</code></pre></div>
<p>
  Instruction is written for high-school comprehension, but the contextual introduction is a bit long to hold attention, and may be best presented in video or animation.

// Use properties of rational and irrational numbers

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*\
| Rational numbers are fairly easy to represent, as they can always be written
|  as a ratio of two integers. Similarly, you can represent many real numbers
|  using rational exponents. The difference between these two types of real
|  numbers is the function that is used to determine their value.
|
| An integer exponent x^n uses the function x^n = x * x * ... * x, where
|  there are n instances of x. A rational exponent x^(1/n) uses the inverse
|  function, that is, x^(1/n) = the number y such that y * y * ... * y = x,
|  where there are n instances of y.
|
| It is not always easy to find an exact evaluation of an inverse function
|  such as a rational power. However, if it is easy to evaluate the function
|  that is inverted, you can use that function to find a good approximation.
|
| One way of approximating is to look at a number that is definitely bigger
|  than the result, and one number that is definitely smaller, and narrow down
|  the range of possibility by checking values in-between. (This method works
|  best when the function is either increasing or decreasing in the interval,
|  and does not change direction.)
|
| This process of narrowing an interval of possibility by testing values one
|  at a time against an inverse function is a type of "iterative method",
|  sometimes informally referred to as "guess and check", and is something
|  that can be done easily using a program.

// First, identify the function you want to approximate, and how to evaluate
//  its inverse. Here, we'll use x^(1/2), or the square-root of x. Its inverse
//  is x^2, or x * x.

function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}

// Now, write functions to choose a lower-bound and upper-bound.
// All real square-roots are greater than or equal to 0, so you can be
//  certain that 0 is smaller than the square root of any number (except 0).
function square_root_lower_bound(x) {
    return 0;
}

// There are many different ways to choose an upper-bound for a square root.
// Here is a simple example, which depends whether the number being
//  square-rooted is less than or greater than 1.
function square_root_upper_bound(x) {
    if(x > 1) {
        // A number greater than one is always larger than its square root.
        // (for example, 4 = 2 * 2, and 4 > 2)
        return x;
    } else if (x < 1) {
        // A number less than one always has a square root less than 1.
        // (for example, 1/4 = 1/2 * 1/2, and 1/2 is less than 1.)
        return 1;
    } else {
        // If the number is neither less than or greater than 1, then it is 1
        //  and its square root is 1.
        return 1;
    }
}

// Choose variables to remember the left and right endpoints of the interval.
var left;
var right;

// Now the main function that will approximate the square root. It should:
//  1. Make sure the right endpoint is greater than the square root, and
//      that the left endpoint is less than the square root. If not, then
//      choose endpoints using the functions you defined above.
//  2. Pick a value inside the interval.
//  3. Evaluate the square and move the endpoints of the interval.
//  3a. If the square of the value is less than the number being square-
//       -rooted, move the left endpoint up to that value.
//  3b. If the square of the value is greater than the number being square-
//       -rooted, move the right endpoint down to that value.
//  4. State the interval of possibility.
function approximate_square_root(x) {
  // 1. Make sure the endpoints are on either side of the square root.
  if (left === undefined || square(left) > x) {
    left = square_root_lower_bound(x);
  }
  if (right === undefined || square(right) < x) {
    right = square_root_upper_bound(x);
  }

  // 2. Pick a value inside the interval. You can do this any way you like,
  //     but the midpoint (average) is nice and easy.
  var test_value = (left + right) / 2;

  // 3. Evaluate the square of that value and move the endpoints.
  if(square(test_value) === x) {
    // If you managed to find the exact square root, you are done.
    left = test_value;
    right = test_value;
    console.log("The square root of " + x + " is " + test_value + ".");
    return;
  } else if(square(test_value) < x) {
    // 3a. Move the left endpoint up if the test value is still too low
    left = test_value;
  } else if(square(test_value) > x) {
    // 3b. Move the right endpoint down if the test value is still too high
    right = test_value;
  }

  // 4. State the interval of possibility.
  console.log("The square root of " + x + " is between " + left + " and " + right);
}

// Each time you run the function, the interval of possibility will get smaller
//  until you find the exact square root. Note that most square-roots are
//  irrational, so you may never get an exact decimal (or binary) value.

// TRY IT!
// Write a function to approximate the cube root of x.
// HINT: The cube root of x is defined for both positive and negative numbers!

function cube(x) {
    return x * x * x;
